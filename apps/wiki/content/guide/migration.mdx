# Wiki Migration Guide

This document outlines the migration of the Vibe Trading Wiki from Rspress to a modern Next.js + Fumadocs stack.

## Why migrate?

- **Ecosystem Alignment:** Rspress was disconnected from the main project's Next.js/TypeScript architecture.
- **Component Reuse:** Using Next.js allows sharing UI components and configurations between the main dashboard and the documentation.
- **Enhanced DX:** Fumadocs provides a superior developer experience for MDX-based documentation with built-in search and better accessibility.

## Key Changes

### Framework
- Replaced `rspress` with `next`, `fumadocs-ui`, and `fumadocs-core`.
- Moved from Rspress routing to Next.js App Router.

### Content Processing
- Integrated `content-collections` for type-safe MDX processing.
- Renamed `_meta.json` to `meta.json` to align with Fumadocs standards.

### Styling
- Adopted Tailwind CSS v4.
- Synchronized color themes (OKLCH) and design tokens with the main `web` application.

## How to add content

1. Place MDX files in `apps/wiki/content/`.
2. Define metadata in frontmatter.
3. Configure sidebar hierarchy in `meta.json`.
